# Strawbry
A dynamically typed programming language with features from the past (like OOP and Null) that gets compiled to bytecode and is run in a virtual machine called SVM (Strawbry Virtual Machine). 

Here is what I want Strawbry to look like:
```js
var a = 1
var b = 2
var c = a + b
print(c)

func sqrt(x) {
    return x ^ 0.5
}
```

Change log:
```
24/9: Class methods
23/9: Classes
21/9: Closures and garbage collection
20/9: Functions
19/9: For loop
18/9: While loop
17/9: If else statements
16/9: Added scopes
```
